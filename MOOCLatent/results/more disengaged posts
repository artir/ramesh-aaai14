I believe we need to be proud of&nbsp;<span>"Statement of Accomplishment"&nbsp; and though we will not and should not equate it with a on campus university course transcript, but we should give its due. I don't understand if various tests and courses by hundreds of training institute and professional courses of duration 2-3 days ( where essentially you just mostly need to sit through and pay a hefty amount) can have credibility why can't coursera course have. I know authenticity is a problem, but its not proper to assume that every certificate lacks any value.<br />&nbsp;I feel as a courseran we first need to be proud that we have got the certificate and proudly show it and argue for it, at least we need to drive home the point to anybody concerned that though my certificate doesn't prove that I am an expert here, but I do have gone through the material and you please do recognize it.If I have got it by fraud, you'll figure it out when you interview me.I also feel that coursera should seriously look into providing a transcript service for a fee and the validity of a certificate can be verified by anyone just like the way you verify university transcripts. I also don't understand why they are not asking for a official photo id while registering for the course.</span> | Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0) AppleWebKit/537.31 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/26.0.1410.64 Safari/537.31

I think that the majority of graders looked for keywords that were in the rubric. I didn't use the keywords, I talked more about what the keywords meant in the context of the problem. Like was said above, I don't plan on taking another peer review course. I posted discussion, I know the material, I have analyzed the data, I know what the data mean, but I am not sure that the reviewers did. That is why they were looking for keywords. <br /><br />I recommend some coursera classes, and I really did like this one, but aside from the knowledge gained on my part, it was a complete waste of time. No way should grading come down to peer reviews. That is just asking for trouble. This is my third coursera class and the second that used peer review and I have absolutely HATED the peer review system. Part of the beauty of a coursera class is that you have lectures on video which relieves the duty of most people of reading, which I think most Americans don't effectively do which is why peer reviews of essays is such a BAD idea.

I agree completely. I used a lot of time on my assignment and got 7.5. I think the evaluation criteria were wrong, it shouldn't be rated on whether you have 3 or 4 innovations in your description but on a subjective measure (which is also flawed).<br />Generally you should pass if it's obvious that you have followed the course and that you have tried to use the theories that the course has(to a certain degree ofc.), 

failed the course even though he followed it.

This has been an otherwise fantastic course. Too bad the potential for success is so heavily weighted on two assignments.

Can a student request for evaluation by staff in border line cases? I'm losing on statement of accomplishment by 0.5 marks. Would really appreciate if any of the staff members can reply. Thanks.

Prof. Lucas, Thank you for a great course! &nbsp;And thank you Coursera! 

nother problem is that to pass you must obtain the full grade on at least one of the answers so I think that this should be relaxed a bit. (14-5 = 9)<br /><br />There is also the problem of people answering the 8 factors on&nbsp;answer&nbsp;2

I have also received a 9, the most disappointing thing
is that I have only received good or passing comments from my peers, 3 of 5 did
not post any comment about my work...

The writer has an interesting story to tell
and does it in admirably good English. I enjoyed getting an insight into TV in
Catalonia. The writer has some imaginative solutions to offer. According to my
assessment, this is a pass!</i><br /><i>
</i><br />
So I do not understand what have happened :( I only hope some teacher could
take a look at the grading to see if some peers gave an outlier note, and the
average or median was lower because of it.<br />
<br />
Thanks!!! <br />
<br />
PS: I learned a lot and the course was very interesting so I have to thank you
a lot for this, but it is the first course that i take and I was exiting about receiving
the certificate.</span></p>

| My 3 favorite innovations are Internet, portable computing ( iDevices), digital entertainment ( music, movies, tv shows)

I am waiting for wearable tech that will make computing ultra portable eliminating even the iDevices.

The second upcoming innovation that I am looking forward to is 3D printing.  I see so many possibilities in this technology including disruption of various industries like shipping, manufacturing, big box stores, transport companies, gas companies, toy industry, food industry etc

|  609 | I was actually thinking about this while watching the first class videos and I definitely think that MOOC's are both sustaining and disruptive. I read an article from, I believe Venture Beat, either late last month or earlier in this month that stated many businesses wouldn't accept an online degree and would rather prefer one from a big name college.

The consensus was - from what I got - is that because a course is online, it's not social enough and businesses like to base hiring on being social, I guess. That also seems to be the same thoughts with universities too. In this sense, these businesses are 1. in denial and 2. are reluctant to change and personally, I think this is what will lead to a major downfall in education and how students are taught.

I say this as someone who has both attended a brick/mortar school and took classes online; personally, I feel I learned a lot more with online schooling than I did in the six years I was at an actual university. The program I was in was focused more, not only my chosen major, but how to use the knowledge in a business world; you know, the place where most people head after college.

Not only that, but I think as someone earlier mentioned, online schooling provides an opportunity for people to even attend school. Since 2010, student loan debt has emerged and surpassed that of credit card debt in the US and thanks to our Great Recession, many grads haven't gotten jobs. Add to the admin costs of colleges continue to rise, you have and will continue to see more and more students working just to feed themselves. I will fully admit that I wish I hadn't gone to college initially or at least waited until colleges started offering courses and degrees online; I would've saved so much money.

As for the social aspect, businesses still aren't understanding that social networking and social media is still *social*. This class reminds me of my other online school, in which discussions were a part of the grade, along with turning in assignments. It was also helpful to me and others who work full time to be able to attend class whenever it works for them. I only had one class in the b/m school that started before 8am and that was only because I was a music major. Personally, I'm hoping for a disruptive change to the status quo as it benefits us as students and not the admins of a college. |
|  616 | As Prof. Lucas mentioned, I didn't even know I needed the Internet until I had it.

I'm pretty lucky that I'm of a generation that initially didn't grow up with the Internet, but was around when computers started to hit the consumers. The Internet has just completely changed the way I work, communicate, everything! The Internet allowed me to not only get and keep in touch with friends from elementary, junior high, high school, and college (Thank you, Facebook), but I've been able to meet others online who have become friends of mine, I've been able to actually achieve my dreams of writing, both personally and professionally thanks to the Internet.

It's also opened other avenues of employment for me; I never would have found my first tech job if I hadn't seen a posting on Craig's List and I certainly wouldn't have the knowledge I do of tech thanks to online courses like these and my online schooling; most of all, I wouldn't have become interested in computer tech or web design or social media if not for the Internet, which as mentioned, as opened new avenues of opportunities of employment for me and others. |
|  621 | I think Jan is right, in that Kodak saw digital as a threat and instead of embracing it, they turned their backs on it. I think we saw the same thing happen to Borders and Blockbusters and I definitely think we're seeing it in the entertainment industry, with Hollywood and music bucking against a new path the Internet is forging for consumers.

Compare this to companies that saw what was happening and said, let's see what happens. Barnes and Noble is probably a great example; I remember having them both in Arizona and I remember that Borders was so much more popular, but then Amazon and eBay came along and while B&N jumped onboard, Borders waited until the very end and by then it was too late. Now B&N is the new top dog because they recognized that consumers could buy in their stores and online.

I also agree with Leslie in the core business values. I think that's why these businesses fail so hard because they look at the financial bottom line and not what their customers want; Kodak kept trying with the same formula when people were discovering, hey my phone takes a great picture! Or I can instantly share these with my folks online! The same is true for Borders, Blockbusters, the entertainment industry, and more. Once a business sees this is where consumers are heading, they should consider how to best change their practices to ensure they are with the consumer and not filing for bankruptcy.  |
|  623 | Douglas, what an interesting question!

I think Samantha is right in that disruptive technologies meet a need, but it can't meet EVERY need. I mentioned in a thread about the sustaining/disruptive technologies we're seeing in the entertainment world. Not sure if anyone remembers Napster, but for me (and those that went through it) it met a need - one for music - but didn't meet every need - such as the artists. Before Napster and the Internet, my money could easily be spent on a $20 CD (or $34+ for a collection) when all I wanted was the song I heard on the radio.

This was before the ability to screen the different tracks and get a taste of the CD itself. I wasn't the only one, hence why Napster was such a great tool; I only want one song, why should I buy a $20 CD? Now the argument is that artists aren't getting paid and we're stealing money, but it's kinda hard to look at someone like Cher or Lady Gaga or Jay-Z who are making millions of dollars and think, 'yes, I could see how my $20 is devastating to them'. Now indie artists are different, but as Radiohead proved a few years, people WILL buy your music, as long as it doesn't suck.

Right now, Hollywood is facing the same thing and with Netflix and Hulu announcing plans for their own series and many people cutting the cable cord, instead of embracing this and saying, let's give what the consumer wants, it's all about money. For the cable companies, stations, and movies, they're only looking at revenue, but if they looked at the consumer, they would see we'll pay for your stuff, you just have to make it available to us. I've actually heard this complaint a lot from friends and others who don't live in the US.

Countries outside the US have to wait months or years before they get content from the US. As Robin from HIMYM notes, the 80s didn't come to Canada until 1998.

In terms of Hollywood, consumers have met their demands and shown what it is we need - we need for this stuff not to be so expensive, especially in light of the Great Recession; we need this stuff to be available and be available on all devices; we need this stuff to be available in any city, state, or country; we need options to pay for what we want.

That's the reason piracy is so big - it's not because we're cheap, it's because we ca't get what we want right now. Take for instance this funny cartoon about trying to get Game of Thrones in order to get caught up before the premiere this week - in it, the guy has his little devil tell him to just download it and the little angel says, no that's illegal. Think of all the people who worked on this.

So the guy starts looking - legally - to watch it. Here's the problem - it's not on Netflix, it's not on Amazon, it's not on Hulu. He can only see it on HBO, but wait! He can only see it on HBO if he's an HBO subscriber, meaning he would have to sign up for HBO on cable. But wait! He doesn't have cable! So essentially he would have to sign up for a cable package, with HBO, and spend an extra $100 dollars a month for one show.

In the end, he ends up just downloading it, which would've saved him the hour in looking.

There's the reason people illegally download; that's also the reason people (usually those of us without children) don't have cable - it's online and Amazon does a pretty good job of having new episodes up within a few hours to a day (unlike Hulu's week).

The evidence is there, but these businesses refuse to see it, either through denial or reluctance to change and in the end, they not only end up losing money, but they lose customers and ultimately their own business. |
| 1247 | I remember when the Hollywood Video that was by my apartments finally shut down, only a few years before Blockbusters was gone too (ironically, HV went because of Blockbuster).

Personally, I'm one of the cable cutters as I don't see the point of having cable when I can find what I want online. This isn't to say that, for instance where I live now, when I have access to cable, I don't use it - especially when I'm paying a portion for it - but it is kinda stupid when I can find what I want online.

Netflix just signed a Disney deal to get some of their archives to stream, not to mention that it currently has two of their own new shows - House of Cards and this interesting look one that's coming in the summer - in production and they're bringing back Arrested Development per fan and cast request. Amazon Prime, for $80 a year, can get me all of the shows - save HBO's Game of Thrones - that I'm currently watching, including new episodes (I was able to actively watch the last season of American Horror Story through Amazon until I moved and caught it on cable)

From what I've seen, the only people who still have cable are those with kids, but even I have to question why they even bother when popular shows are online too. Again, Netflix has most of Nick's stuff (though they haven't updated Spongebob in forever) and as mentioned, many classic Disney movies are now available for streaming. Sesame Street was at one time streaming there too, but you can find classic SS (the good ole days!) on PBS.

Linda, I saw that you mentioned some of the gems that you could find in a video store, but they're online too. I was quite happy at finding the original The Haunting is streaming - for free - on Amazon and I have many classic movies in my Netflix que - House on Haunted Hill (original), High Anxiety, The Producers (original); I was even able to rewatch Sesame Street's Follow That Bird on Netflix, a movie I originally saw in theaters when I was six, and I was able to share that with my friend's three year old.

And to go with that, I was able to show her episodes of the Muppet Show thanks to YouTube. As someone who grew up with the Muppets, I'm more familiar with their movies and not the show, so there are a lot of episodes I had never seen. And thanks to YouTube, I was able to show the Muppet (I deemed her Muppet cause of her growing fondness that matched my own) episodes of Muppet Babies, again a show I hadn't seen since the awesome days of Saturday Morning Cartoons (and I still remember that it came on at like 6am too!)

Again, I can't understand why people even still have cable at this point, other than maybe the premium channels like HBO or Showtime. With that said, I am annoyed that HBO won't even consider doing just stand alone for their shows (even though the CEO discussed it in a recent interview, but like Kodak, doesn't want to disrupt their partnerships with cable companies); that in itself is ironic, because that's only going to lead me - and others - to just pirate their shows because that's the only way we can view them.  |
| 1255 | I don't think Kodak can come back from this, unless they seriously get their act together and realize that they are an imaging company and nothing else. As Premal noted, commercial printing is still around, but you have to basically have to knock out both HP and Xerox in order to even get in the door. And personally, those printers have to be wireless enabled and with an extra bonus of being able to print from either a smartphone or tablet (like with Google Print).

As the one HP employee noted, Kodak ignored consumers and ignored that the consumer was in control. That is especially true now, even a year after their bankruptcy - just look businesses like Kickstarter; just recently, fans of the show Veronica Mars got the movie they always wanted. Both Netflix and Hulu are producing their own shows and YouTube is the king of user content. When Kodak finally realizes that they don't control the business, consumers do, then they might have a chance.                                                                |
| 1394 | Doug, I saw your post in one of the other threads and went to find the one you did here.<br /><br />I was never a fan of Blockbuster for their late fees; I was a fan of Hollywood Video and some of the smaller stores. Even when threatened with the emergence of Netflix, Blockbuster didn't get onboard to the online portion of their site until they realized people didn't rent movies anymore.<br /><br />Netflix, along with Hulu and Amazon, have created technologies that everyone in the entertainment world continues to buck against. It's something I've mentioned in other threads, so I'm really looking forward to speaking about BB and Borders in regards to it, but you're right; these companies don't see teh forest for the trees, as the saying goes. I think Blockbuster had the same thought Kodak did - they were highly popular, in many cases THE number source for video rentals and when they saw the Internet come along, with Netflix and Hulu, they dismissed it.<br /><br />Even when they jumped online, they still had these ridiculous late fees, which for a service like Netflix which has no late fees rose in dominance with their consumers, who were sick of paying fees for stuff they could get online for one low monthly price. |
| 2119 | I made a note to the professor, but I was in the Hangout and it looks I and someone else were battling it out for ninth place. Hangouts will only allow nine people, so with the professor, the person taking the emails and the person watching Twitter, make up the three adjunct, so six people have to be chosen, not seven.<br /><br />I will say that having the live YouTube video was great!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 2122 | Grrr...responded to this and had an error.&nbsp;<br /><br />I did indeed see this story and as the article I read points out, very clearly, they are doing everything they can to drive AWAY customers. many businesses who are dealing with showrooming are trying to combat it at least in a positive for consumers - buy either having wi-fi so they can shop for what they want or at least making it available online.<br /><br />The problem I see is that many of their in store products are NOT online, which means people need to go to the store. Why, when they can find what they need from another place online or find it cheaper? I admit to doing this, unless it's something I need immediately (like a PSU or video card). Companies would do a lot better by knowing and learning that the consumer is what's trying their business now and we're showing that we will take our business elsewhere because we can.                                                                                                                           |
| 3164 | Personally, I think the cloud is already a disruptive technology. Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu are great examples of this in terms of their disrupting the video and cable providers; many people usually have at least two of these, in order to get everything they want. While I have cable now, when I move out, I'm planning on just Netflix and Amazon - Netflix for classic/some current movie selections and Amazon for new episodes of shows I'm watching (and free shipping).<br /><br />Another great example is Google vs Microsoft. If anyone has been reading the tech news since Microsoft introduced their Surface tablets, you'll know that M$ has been really pushing people to use Skydrive and now their Office online, because they are competing with Google's cloud, like Drive. Google Drive (formally Docs) is free up to 5GB. I actually just purchased the $5 option for 100GB when I started hitting the 5GB mark.<br /><br />Then there's Evernote, which is now seeing competition from Google with their note taking service. One of the reasons I stopped using Microsoft's OneNote, which came with Office, was because I could only use it on my computers; OneNote didn't even come to Windows own smartphones until...a year ago, IIRC. Evernote is not only free (with a premium and now business plan), but is cross platform.<br /><br />And I think that's another big key as why cloud tech is already killing - most people have multiple devices that don't run on the same platform. I have a desktop and laptop that both run Windows, but I have an Android phone; I know people who have Windows machines, an iPad, and an Android phone. With the way most people run their personal or professional lives, the ability to access that picture from your phone to your desktop or watch a movie on Netflix on your tablet from the car and then finish it on your smart TV or HTPC is convenient and in many cases, cheaper than shilling out $100+ for cable or DVD fees. |
| 3171 | I third your analysis, Jeff, though I do disagree with some points. I think their denial - for me - was a ten, for what you said about Huizenga. Someone who didn't even own a VCR investing in a VHS/DVD company was wrong in the start and pretty much was writing on the wall. I think the&nbsp;resistance&nbsp;to change is also higher, only because I vaguely remember that Blockbuster only started putting games on the shelf (which were mostly XBOX and PS2 games) because they saw GameStop (?) getting so much attention for their model (ironic, as even GameStop is being disrupted by things like XBOX live and Steam).<br /><br />I remember reading a bunch about Netflix (as I'm a subscriber) and I remember that the reason they were splitting the two apart was because the DVD model WAS costing them money and that, IIRC, they had more people streaming than were renting DVDs. Now, the obvious problem is I don't think they took into account that many people have both plans - DVD AND streaming (I know my friends did).<br /><br />Also, if I remember right, Qwikster was also supposed to give customers the ability to rent video games too, in order to compete with GameFly, but obviously they realized that was stupid (especially, as I noted above, there's X Live and Steam).<br /><br />I think Netflix right now is seeing that people are going for content and content they can get now. Their House of Card series has been praised as being one of the best new series and I know they have two more original content shows coming out this summer, plus what most people have been waiting for, season 4 of Arrested Development. They were also the first to get the rights to Star Trek and all spin offs, with Hulu just showing them for this week for free (because of the Star Trek sequel).<br /><br />As a subscriber of Netflix, I'm fairly happy with the movie selection, though I'm mostly going to be watching older stuff, but I am happy about my TV show selection. I think for the moment, Netflix sees that people would rather get their show in one big lump instead of staggered through the week as it is now, especially if a person is new to a show. Also, if Netflix can get these licenses, I believe it would help to curb online piracy; that's something I think Amazon does slightly better because they allow for current shows vs. Netflix's slow update of new seasons for a current show. |
| 3172 | I think it was denial, especially with a clear technophobe (as someone mentioned in another thread) steering the ship. Even before disruptive technologies were a thought, Huizenga was denying it would ever affect them. That's pretty good denial foresight right there!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 3178 | Personally, I doubt it.<br /><br />One of the reasons that theaters are losing money is 1. cost and 2. lack of imagination from Hollywood. I don't know about where you are, but movies here in Denver are $9.50 regular and then about...$17 (?) for IMAX/3D and that's just the ticket price. I spend less on Netflix and if I totaled how much I spent on movies, with treats, it would probably be less than what a person would spend for Amazon Prime.<br /><br />And then there's the great minds of Hollywood - it's only been in the last year or so that original movies have even come out and in some cases, those are Indie films which don't even hit the mainstream theater.<br /><br />The reason, I think and believe, that streaming services and online piracy are big is because people can get content immediately and on a variety of different devices. Have you ever been to see a movie on opening day or at a midnight showing? While fun in the people watching category, you may not be able to get tickets or you get tickets and aren't able to see the movie.<br /><br />I remember going to see Titanic when it first came out with friends and we couldn't see it cause of all the Leo fangirls. We ended up having to exchange our tickets to see something else. That's time taken - time to plan, time to schedule, time out on a Saturday, money for the ticket, time trying to convince the manager to let us see something else, etc.<br /><br />Time it takes to stream a movie? Two seconds, depending on your Internet connection and I can start watching something on my desktop, stop it, move to my laptop and finish watching it. Or start watching it on a smart TV, stop it, and finish while going on a trip on my tablet or smartphone.<br /><br />Does this mean I think disruptive technologies will bury the theaters? No. It'll be the same process as the introduction to TV helped advertise movies; unless it's something that I know from the get go I want to see, I'll stream it first. If it sucks, I haven't wasted money and I can easily skip ahead to see if it's even worth watching completely. If it's good, I'll probably want to see it in theaters or I'll want to buy the movie (if I missed it in theaters) |

| 5325 | My favorite innovations, in no particular order:<br /><br />Microwave - very handy and now with so many options to quickly cook your food!<br />Social Media - such a great way to improve communication. However, I'm not a fan of the privacy that has seemed to have been lost because of it.<br />Internet - I'm not sure if it has made people smarter, but it certainly has done wonders!                                                |
| 5326 | You may be correct on this, however your paragraph doesn't seem to completely explain your ratings. I'm curious about Blockbuster's strategy to survive. It's tough to get into the game when they have been so late getting into it in the first place.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 5328 | I agree with you for the most part. I think Barnes and Noble has a shot at survival because there are enough people who like going to the store. It also helps that they serve Starbucks and I think they have a digital network for Nook owners. At the same time, I don't know how much longer they will survive. Amazon has lower prices and just seems to be an easy option for most customers. They also have a very large customer base. |

| 2078 | My favorite innovations of all time are three found on Businessweek article: the wheel (which lead to a lot of other innovations, products and services that makes us live better), agriculture and domesticated animals (so that we can act and make decisions for our own lives instead of having to escape from animals or chaging places after all available food has finished) and the Internet (I can't remember how my life was before the Internet. I do everything on the internet now. Working, communicating, studying, banking, buying...).<br />Just the Internet was created in the last 25 years, but there are so many others derived from it that I can' even name just the 3 more important ones.<br />                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 2376 | All the companies and all the industries may be distructed tomorrow! If Google doesn't keep innovating and getting to try new products and services, it will die because others are.<br /><br />I currently work in a retail company and I feel like that. It is a famous and stablished company nationwide which have some competitive advantages over other companies (such as high quality service and the most innovative products in the market). <br /><br />However, more and more worldwide companies are coming (and also national start-ups) and extinguishing well-established brands.<br /><br />What do I think? This competition and this continuous innovation makes people live better lifes. Sometimes it is difficult to change, there is a lot of bureacracy and people are even scared about what will come the next. <br />I might not know what is coming in the future, but it will definitely help us have better lifes!<br />                                                                                                           |
| 2377 | I had recently read Nokia's Annual report and I was amazed! They seem to be either too realistic or either pessimistic about the threatens in its industry.<br /><br />They are aware of their situation and the most important for them now, in my opinion, is having a good management that leads the colaborators in a way they can change theur current situtation. <br /><br />Innovating in products, services, serving people better, investing in research and development might be possible solutions.<br />                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

have a great potential for being the greatest competitive advantage for a
company because of the high costs and risks (especially in the case it is
outsourced) comparing to other parts of the chain.</p>

<p>In Amazon,
the broad product line offered by major American brands is also in my opinion
its main advantage.</p>

<p>Barnes
&amp; Noble has realized it is much in disadvantage compared to its competitors
and has finally decided to invest in digitals. The partnership with Microsoft definitely
helps in terms of acquiring some expertise and know-how in the field. However,
it has already lost the first-mover advantage and its miles away from the main
players in the market.</p>

<p><a target="">&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>About the tablet being launched, they say thay
are not competing with iPad. They are conscious of their disadvantage in competing in the same
market and have decided to change the focus of their devices.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I myself
didn’t even know about this launch before reading the article posted in the assignments
page! In my country, there are no Barnes and Nobles (although there are Apple
Stores!), but I would say the product is not much successful…</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is it
better off in Britain?</p>

| 5024 | I had never used to read a daily newspaper, but a weekly one when I was younger. <br />I just buy newspapers when I go for a coffee on Sundays or Saturdays, during the morning, with my fiancée. It's a social time. Not only for getting to know the news, but to spend some time together and discuss about Economics, Politics, Culture, Society...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 5028 | I really enjoy getting to know examples of business that go "well" in industries that are said to go "bad".<br /><br />I believe there is always a solution if companies adapt themselves for keeping competitive. The solution given in the end of the article seem to be well-known by everyone, but it does not always have the same result. Probably even for external variables, like cultural differences and priorities, incentives, economics...<br /><br />In Brazil, most media companies selling famous written newspapers are also having losses. But are the revenues too small or are costs too high?<br />For example, I guess the distribution costs throughout Brazil are much higher than in Norway or Sweden - not only because the size of the territory itself but also for the lack of efficient means of transportation/infrastructure.<br />Newspapers are print every single day. Timing is a competitive advantage and so is logistics. How many papers must be sold for covering the fixed costs?<br />If the costs were half their size, half the sales would be enough for covering them (generally speaking). |

| 6801 | In Brazil, most telecom operators have bonuses, discounts or even free calls if you recharge your phone between days X and Y, or if you charge more than US$X, or if you are calling someone from the same operator.<br />It was a little difficult in the beginning, but today people generally ask you" which is your network?" and have different devices according to their plans in each operator!<br />Quite complex! And it was also a little weird in the beginning. But today people are more used to being asked which operator they use because of such differences in prices depending on the carrier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 7125 | Actually, in "The Paradox of the Choice", Schwartz describes an experiment in which offering people 20 kinds of jams to choose from made the purchases much more difficult than offering people just 6 flavors to choose from. <br />People were unsure about how to choose and were more in doubt if any other of the 19 flavors were better than the chosen one. It's more time spent in comparing the products, more products that would satisfy our palate in the same way and it generated doubts (and consequently, some "unhappiness") among customers.<br />                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

&nbsp;send letters, there is competition from

| 7407 | The grades I received are ridiculous! One pointed out that the good point in my assignment was my fluency in English!!! Oh God!<br /><br />Another one told me that I used "general knowledge" for asking the questions. Yes, I've tried to use "general knowldege" for applying the theory so that it is useful (and not just a theory!).<br /><br />I've re-read my assignment and I still can't believe in my grade.

| 4602 | Although I love the "paper" news, I was born in it, literally... my parents dedicated their professional existence, beyond the "Iron Curtain", to fight for free independent press, they got it at the end. Now however, they often not quite sure "what?" "if?" that was worth it...especially when seeing contemporary global media and interests.&nbsp; <br />I cannot imagine the world without the paper but it is becoming more clear we might have to soon. I already have noticed that I personally use way more electronic (paid for) newspapers for IPad or Androids, which as David Carr says in Page One documentary "feels exactly like...the newspaper." Working around the world constantly does not always allow for such luxury as constant access to&nbsp; favorite paper global titles, the digital version on kindle or IPad is a fantastic alternative. The digital paper in this format offers also new interesting advertising options, allows to cut the costs significantly an hopefully keep the quality...I always liked utopian thinking...&nbsp; <br /><br />Considering massive environmental costs of keeping the paper, possibly the digital paid version is a fair compromise! <br /><br /><i><b>If you have a chance check this interesting documentary:</b> </i><i>Page One: Inside the New York Times, 2011, Andrew Rossi. </i><br /><br /> | 2013-04-07                     |
| 4649 | If I can I do but every time I have any of my favorite titles from around the globe in may hands in paper form I consider it a complete luxury (on the other hand it is a luxury that adds to environmental ticking bombs). But for example you look to Burma where people there for the first time in decades are enjoying&nbsp; "almost" free press movement again in paper form. As always these kind of discussions or analysis, as any, pends on point of view, location or culture. On the other hand it is what is making it sooo fascinating!
